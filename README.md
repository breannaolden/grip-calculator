# grip-calculator
A simple calculator for finding average grip strength using a Dynamometer. Created in C++

The protocol for completing grip testing using a JAMAR hydraulic hand Dynamometer involves taking three measurements from both right and left hands, alternating sides between squeezes. This calculator takes measurements as they come, calculate the average for right and left respectively, then list the individual measurements for each hand.
